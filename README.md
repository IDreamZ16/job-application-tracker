# Job Application Tracker

A full-stack web app for tracking job applications, contacts, and interview activity through the hiring process. Built as a portfolio project to demonstrate end-to-end engineering: schema design, REST API development, authenticated React UI, Dockerized local development, and (coming soon) automated testing and CI/CD.

**Live demo:** *coming soon*

## Features

- **Authentication** — JWT-based register and login with bcrypt password hashing
- **Job tracking** — Create, edit, and delete job applications with status, salary range, location, and notes; switch between grouped card view and table view
- **Job detail pages** — Full application dossier with editable fields, deletable with confirmation, and dedicated sections for contacts and activities
- **Contacts** — Track recruiters, hiring managers, and referrals per job, with one-click email, phone, and LinkedIn links
- **Activities timeline** — Log every touchpoint (phone screens, interviews, follow-ups, offers, rejections) on a chronological per-job timeline
- **Dashboard** — At-a-glance summary of applications by status, plus a focused view of jobs currently in interviewing or offer stages

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React 18 with Vite for the build pipeline
- React Router for client-side routing
- TanStack Query for server-state management (caching, invalidation, background refetching)
- Axios with request/response interceptors for JWT handling
- Tailwind CSS with a custom dark theme; Syne and DM Sans for typography
- Lucide React for icons

**Backend**
- Node.js with Express
- PostgreSQL with raw `pg` queries (no ORM)
- JWT for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing
- express-validator for request validation

**Infrastructure**
- Docker Compose for local development (Postgres, backend, frontend)
- Versioned SQL migrations
- Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend + database) for production *(setup in progress)*

## Architecture

The frontend is a single-page application that talks to the backend via a REST API. Authentication is stateless — JWTs are stored in `localStorage` and attached to every request via an Axios interceptor; a 401 response triggers a redirect to the login screen.

The backend is a thin Express layer over a PostgreSQL schema with foreign-key relationships across users, jobs, contacts, and activities. All multi-tenant queries enforce ownership at the SQL level (`WHERE user_id = $1`), so a user can never read or modify another user's data even if their JWT is leaked or spoofed for a different account.

The database schema is managed through versioned SQL migration files and applied automatically on first Docker volume initialization. Updated-at timestamps are maintained by a Postgres trigger function rather than application code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ and npm (only needed if you want to run tests or the frontend dev server outside Docker)

### Setup

Clone the repo and create a `.env` file at the project root with your Postgres credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then create a backend env file:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Edit `backend/.env` and set `JWT_SECRET` to something random.

### Running the Stack

Bring everything up:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts three containers: `job_tracker_db` (Postgres on `:5432`), `job_tracker_backend` (Express on `:5000`), and `job_tracker_frontend` (Vite dev server on `:3000`). Migrations run automatically on first start.

Once the containers are healthy:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend health check: http://localhost:5000/api/health

To tail logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

To bring everything down:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To wipe the database and start fresh:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

The `-v` flag removes the Postgres volume, so migrations will re-run on the next `up`.

## Database

Migrations live in `database/migrations/` as numbered SQL files. Filenames starting with `000_` are reserved for Docker init scripts (like creating the test database) and are skipped by the schema migration runner.

The schema:

- **users** — accounts with hashed passwords
- **jobs** — applications, foreign-keyed to users with cascade delete
- **contacts** — people associated with a job, foreign-keyed to both jobs and users
- **activities** — timestamped log entries per job, foreign-keyed to both jobs and users
- **triggers** — automatic `updated_at` maintenance via a Postgres trigger function

To apply migrations manually against a running database:

```bash
cd backend
npm run migrate
```

## API Overview

All routes except register and login require a `Bearer <token>` Authorization header.
